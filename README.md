# Introduction
Intel® P4 Studio Software Development Environment (SDE) is a set of packages for programming Intel’s line of programmable Ethernet Switches. The package also contains scripts for building and installing SDE. The fully automated script (install.sh) introduced in this release works in conjunction with the existing command line interface tool (p4studio) to ease the build and installation process. The following sections describe how to build and install the Intel P4 Studio SDE.
Note: SDE Release 9.5.0 and earlier uses p4studio_build.py CLI tool to build and install the SDE.
